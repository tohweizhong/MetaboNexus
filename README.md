## Abstract

MetaboNexus is an interactive metabolomics data analysis platform that integrates pre-processing of raw peak data with in-depth statistical analysis and metabolite identity search. It is designed to work as a desktop application hence uploading large files to web servers is not required. This could speed up the data analysis process because server queries or queues are avoided, while ensuring security of confidential clinical data on a local computer. With MetaboNexus, users can progressively start from data pre-processing, multi- and univariate analysis to metabolite identity search of significant molecular features, thereby seamlessly integrating critical steps for metabolite biomarker discovery. Data exploration can be first performed using principal components analysis, while prediction and variable importance can be calculated using partial least squares-discriminant analysis and Random Forest. After identifying putative features from multi- and univariate analyses (e.g. t test, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test), users can seamlessly determine the molecular identity of these putative features. To assist users in data interpretation, MetaboNexus also automatically generates graphical outputs, such as score plots, diagnostic plots, boxplots, receiver operating characteristic plots and heatmaps. The metabolite search function will match the mass spectrometric peak data to three major metabolite repositories, namely HMDB, MassBank and METLIN, using a comprehensive range of molecular adducts. Biological pathways can also be searched within MetaboNexus. MetaboNexus is available with installation guide and tutorial at http://www.sph.nus.edu.sg/index.php/research-services/research-centres/ceohr/metabonexus, and is meant for the Windows Operating System, XP and onwards (preferably on 64-bit). In summary, MetaboNexus is a desktop-based platform that seamlessly integrates the entire data analytical workflow and further provides the putative identities of mass spectrometric data peaks by matching them to databases.
